# dev-container

This directory is most useful when the project is opened with Visual
Studio Code. The container will automatically be built and the project
will be opened in the new container.

If executing from the command line, use the following:

```bash
docker compose up -d
docker exec -it devenv-devenv-1  /bin/zsh
```
